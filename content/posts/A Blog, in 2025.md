When hearing the word **Blog**, many will think of something old. 

*"Blog, that used to be something on the old internet"*

That is sort of right, in the end. A lot of people used to have a Blog. But then social media sites came along, and gave everyone their own profile. A miniature Blog, you could say. That can be seen by anyone on that Platform as well. The Appeal is certainly there.

But I don't want to write posts on something like Twitter, Facebook or Bluesky for a few Reasons.
- I have to rely on this website continuing to exist
- They have the power to take down my posts and account at any time
- If I want to cover a bigger topic with a bigger post, these sites quickly show me limits

And given that I would like to create a "Knowledge Database" for myself, it is only logical to run my own version of...something.
I might as well share these posts, since these knowledge deposits surely can be helpful for someone else too.
Even when I write a post about something that is just my opinion, perhaps SOMEONE out there will find it appealing.

A man named Tiago Forte wrote a Book, having the title **Building a Second Brain**. The idea is simple. The execution can be whatever you feel like putting into it. Write down.
Write down your ideas, experiences and thoughts, into readable formats that can be saved elsewhere. Accessible at any time to remind yourself of some info's and knowledge. Otherwise you would have to try to remember it all, all the time. I already know from my own experience, that does not work.
And then, once you have some things written down, in a nice to read format, you can have that saved on, lets say a Website. You can give each experience and thought its own area. You could call it a Post. And with all these posts combined, oh. You have a Blog!

And here we are. I am starting my own Blog. To document things that I redeem important enough to save long term. Let it be some experiences I want to describe or a guide on how to do something very technical and specific.

Welcome. You see this, so I seemingly managed to host the Blog somewhere. At the time of writing it (2025-03-29 16:25) I just type text in a Editor. If the result actually makes it on a website, is not something I factually know yet. You do, funny huh.

One Note. One Post. One Blog. One Second Brain.

For credits sake, I would like to state that the Editor I use is Obsidian: https://obsidian.md/
The overall realization of turning it into a Blog is guided by NetworkChuck: https://networkchuck.com/ (Visually a very wonderful Site, by the way)
